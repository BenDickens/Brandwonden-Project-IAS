The ABM is currently only in a demo state, many of the features are unvalidated or
hacky, however I am working on a detailed method and model description.

The model has four agent types: neutrophils (green), macrophages (M1-Blue, M2-Cyan)
, fibroblasts (unimplemented), and endothelial (tan-healthy, red- 0 oxygen / coagulated,
orange - intermediate healthy).

Instead of being modelled as agents the cytokine levels are attached to the endothelial
cells, acting as a state space / environment, that are secreted and attracted (mainly macrophages)
by cells.  Later, these can be output as heat maps, and used to govern attractant gradients.  

M1 macrophages are the pro-inflammatory phenotype, whilst M2 are the anti-inflammatory 
phenotype.  These macrophages secrete and are attracted by different cytokines.  Given the
appropriate micro-environment M1 macrophages modulate to M2.

The cytokines included in the model so far are IL-6 and TNFa (pro-inflammatory), IL-10
(anti-inflammatory) and TGFb (growth factor).  Future extensions may include cytokines such as:
TGFa, PDGF, VEGF, IL-1Î²; whilst other cytokines are easier to generalise into pro or 
anti.  

Oxygen content (of the endothelial cells) acts as a general proxy for health but also
the amount of blood exposure that cell has (at least at start of simulation).  Neutrophils
and macrophages behaviour is also governed by the level of oxygen in neighbouring cells.
